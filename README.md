# S'Woradu

A submission for a game jam, with the theme of "Impossibly Huge Anime Sword but Also It Is a Gun (aka:  Gunblade)". All sound effects, music, art assets, and code are made by me. Inspired by "Gitaroo Man" for the PS2. *UwU~!*

Here's a link to play the game: https://monster860.github.io/s-woradu/
